# Performance Optimization

## Cython Modules

- Located in `src/optimizations/cython_modules`.
- Compiled for faster execution of critical sections.
- Example: `math_operations.pyx` leverages C++ functions for performance.

## C++ Extensions

- Located in `src/optimizations/cpp_modules`.
- Use PyBind11 for seamless integration with Python.
- Example: `math_operations.cpp` provides high-performance functions like `reverse_string`.

## Go Service

- Located in `src/optimizations/go_service`.
- Handles concurrent requests efficiently.
- Optimized for low latency and high throughput.

## Benchmarking

Use the benchmarking script to compare performance:

```bash
make benchmark
```

*(Note: Adjust `--n` and `--iterations` based on your requirements.)*

## Optimizing Model Performance

- **Batch Processing:** Implement batch processing in the prediction endpoint to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
- **Caching:** Utilize Redis to cache frequent predictions, reducing latency and API calls.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Use asynchronous programming paradigms in FastAPI and Go to handle I/O-bound tasks efficiently.
